  "description": "Zstandard is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression\nratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while\nbeing backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for\nsmall data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from\nany sample set. Zstandard library is provided as open source software using\na BSD license.",
